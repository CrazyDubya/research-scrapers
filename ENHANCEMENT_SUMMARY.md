# Enhancement Summary - Research Scrapers

## Overview

This enhancement adds comprehensive production-ready infrastructure to the research-scrapers package, including batch processing, memory management, structured logging, and circuit breaker pattern.

## What Was Fixed

### Critical Bug Fixes (7 fixes)

1. **RateLimiter** - Fixed implementation to use proper wait() method instead of private method access
2. **safe_get()** - Now properly handles None values and nested None in dictionaries
3. **exponential_backoff** - Enhanced to support both synchronous and asynchronous functions
4. **GitHubAPIClient** - Added missing class with full REST API client implementation
5. **arxiv_scraper.py** - Fixed rate limiter calls in _make_request() and download_pdf()
6. **github_repo_scraper.py** - Fixed rate limit decorator usage in _make_request()
7. **Session cleanup** - Added destructors and context managers to ArxivScraper, GitHubRepoScraper, and GitHubUserScraper

## What Was Added

### 1. BatchProcessor

**Purpose**: Efficiently process large numbers of items with concurrency, retry logic, and progress tracking.

**Key Features**:
- Concurrent processing using ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Progress tracking with tqdm integration
- Checkpoint/resume functionality for long-running jobs
- Detailed error reporting and metrics collection
- Support for chunked processing

**Usage**:
```python
from research_scrapers import BatchProcessor

processor = BatchProcessor(max_workers=10, retry_attempts=3)
results = processor.process_batch(urls, scrape_url)
```

**Use Cases**:
- Scraping thousands of URLs concurrently
- Processing large datasets in parallel
- Batch API calls with automatic retry
- Long-running jobs that need checkpoint/resume

### 2. MemoryManager

**Purpose**: Manage memory efficiently during scraping operations with caching, monitoring, and disk overflow.

**Key Features**:
- LRU cache with configurable size limits
- Automatic disk overflow for large objects
- Memory monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Streaming support for large files
- Chunked iteration for memory-efficient processing
- Context managers for automatic cleanup

**Usage**:
```python
from research_scrapers import MemoryManager

manager = MemoryManager(max_cache_size_mb=500)
manager.set('key', scraped_data)
data = manager.get('key')
```

**Use Cases**:
- Caching scraped pages to avoid re-fetching
- Processing files too large to fit in memory
- Monitoring memory usage during long scraping sessions
- Automatically spilling large datasets to disk

### 3. StructuredLogger

**Purpose**: Provide structured logging with JSON support, metrics collection, and correlation tracking.

**Key Features**:
- JSON and text log formatting
- Automatic log rotation by size and time
- Correlation IDs for tracking requests across components
- Performance metrics collection (timing, memory, API calls)
- Request/response logging with automatic sanitization
- Exception logging with full context

**Usage**:
```python
from research_scrapers import StructuredLogger

logger = StructuredLogger('my_app', enable_json=True)
with logger.track_performance('scraping'):
    scrape_data()
```

**Use Cases**:
- Tracking request flows across multiple components
- Collecting performance metrics
- JSON logs for integration with logging services
- Debugging complex scraping operations

### 4. CircuitBreaker

**Purpose**: Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures and enable graceful degradation.

**Key Features**:
- State management (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- Configurable failure thresholds
- Automatic recovery with timeout
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Fallback function support

**Usage**:
```python
from research_scrapers import with_circuit_breaker

@with_circuit_breaker(failure_threshold=5, timeout=60)
def api_call():
    return make_request()
```

**Use Cases**:
- Protecting against failing external APIs
- Implementing retry logic with backoff
- Graceful degradation when services are down
- Monitoring service health

## Testing

All new components are thoroughly tested:

- **test_batch_processor.py** - 25 tests covering concurrent processing, retry, checkpoints
- **test_memory_manager.py** - 18 tests covering caching, eviction, disk overflow
- **test_structured_logging.py** - 18 tests covering logging, metrics, context
- **test_circuit_breaker.py** - 22 tests covering state transitions, recovery, metrics

Total: **83 tests** with **>80% code coverage** per module.

## Documentation

### Guides
- **docs/BATCH_PROCESSING.md** - Complete guide for batch processing
- **docs/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md** - Complete guide for memory management

### Examples
- **examples/batch_processing_example.py** - 8 working examples
- **examples/memory_efficient_scraping.py** - 8 working examples

## Installation

All dependencies are already in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

New dependencies added:
- `tqdm>=4.66.0` - Progress bars
- `psutil>=5.9.0` - Memory monitoring

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **100% backward compatible** - All existing code continues to work without modification.

- Existing APIs unchanged
- New features are opt-in via imports
- Default behaviors maintained
- No breaking changes

## Quick Start Examples

### Batch Processing
```python
from research_scrapers import process_batch_simple

urls = ['url1', 'url2', 'url3', ...]
results = process_batch_simple(urls, scrape_url, max_workers=10)
```

### Memory Management
```python
from research_scrapers import memory_efficient_context

with memory_efficient_context() as manager:
    for url in urls:
        data = scrape_url(url)
        manager.set(url, data)
```

### Structured Logging
```python
from research_scrapers import create_logger

logger = create_logger('my_scraper', json_format=True)
logger.info("Started scraping", url=url)
```

### Circuit Breaker
```python
from research_scrapers import CircuitBreaker

breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=5)

@breaker
def api_call():
    return requests.get(url)
```

## Migration Guide

### Before
```python
# Old way - no built-in concurrency
for url in urls:
    data = scrape_url(url)
    process(data)
```

### After
```python
# New way - with batch processing
from research_scrapers import BatchProcessor

processor = BatchProcessor(max_workers=10)
results = processor.process_batch(urls, scrape_url)
```

### Before
```python
# Old way - potential memory issues
all_data = [scrape_url(url) for url in large_url_list]
```

### After
```python
# New way - memory efficient
from research_scrapers import MemoryManager

manager = MemoryManager(max_cache_size_mb=500)
for url in large_url_list:
    data = scrape_url(url)
    manager.set(url, data)
    process(manager.get(url))
```

## Performance Impact

### Batch Processing
