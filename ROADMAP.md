# Research Scrapers - Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, improvements, and integrations for the Research Scrapers project.

## 🎯 Vision

To create a comprehensive, production-ready toolkit for scraping and analyzing data from various research and project management sources, with seamless integrations across popular platforms.

---

## 🚀 Planned Features

### Linear Integration (RUB-50) - **In Planning**

We are developing a comprehensive Linear API integration to enable seamless project management and issue tracking capabilities within Research Scrapers.

#### Overview

The Linear integration will provide a robust, production-ready interface for interacting with Linear's API, similar to our existing GitHub scraper. This will enable users to:

- Extract project data, issues, and workflows from Linear workspaces
- Synchronize Linear data with other platforms (GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- Automate project management workflows
- Generate analytics and reports from Linear data

#### Key Features

**Core Functionality:**
- 🔐 OAuth 2.0 and API key authentication
- 📊 Workspace, team, and project data extraction
- 🐛 Issue and sub-issue scraping with full metadata
- 👥 User and team member information retrieval
- 🏷️ Label, status, and workflow state management
- 📝 Comment and attachment handling
- 🔄 Real-time updates via webhooks (future)

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- ⚡ Automatic pagination and rate limiting
- 🔄 Retry logic with exponential backoff
- 💾 Built-in caching for repeated requests
- ✅ Data validation and schema enforcement
- 🎯 Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- 📈 Analytics and reporting utilities

#### Technical Implementation

**Architecture:**
```

├── linear/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── client.py           # Core Linear API client
│   ├── models.py           # Data models and validation
│   ├── endpoints.py        # API endpoint handlers
│   ├── auth.py             # Authentication management
│   ├── webhooks.py         # Webhook handling (future)
│   └── utils.py            # Linear-specific utilities
└── integrations/
    ├── linear_github.py    # Linear <-> GitHub sync
    ├── linear_notion.py    # Linear <-> Notion sync
    └── linear_export.py    # Export utilities
```

**Dependencies:**
- `gql`: GraphQL client for Linear's API
- `pydantic`: Data validation and modeling
- `tenacity`: Retry logic and error handling
- `aiohttp`: Async HTTP requests (optional)

#### Usage Examples

**Basic Issue Scraping:**
```python
from research_scrapers import LinearScraper

# Initialize with API key
scraper = LinearScraper(api_key="lin_api_xxx")

# Get all issues from a team
issues = scraper.scrape_issues(
    team_key="RUB",
    state="active",
    limit=100
)

# Access issue details
for issue in issues:
    print(f"{issue.identifier}: {issue.title}")
    print(f"Status: {issue.state.name}")
    print(f"Assignee: {issue.assignee.name if issue.assignee else 'Unassigned'}")
```

**Project Data Extraction:**
```python
# Get project with all issues
project = scraper.scrape_project(
    project_key="RUB-50",
    include_issues=True,
    include_comments=True
)

# Save to JSON
scraper.save_data(project, "linear_project_data.json")
```

**GitHub Integration:**
```python
from research_scrapers.integrations import sync_linear_to_github

# Sync Linear issues to GitHub
sync_linear_to_github(
    linear_team="RUB",
    github_repo="CrazyDubya/research-scrapers",
    mapping_config="./config/linear-github-mapping.json"
)
```
