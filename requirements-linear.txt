# Linear API Integration Dependencies

# No additional dependencies needed for basic Linear integration
# The update_linear_task.py script uses only Python standard library:
# - urllib.request for HTTP requests
# - json for JSON handling
# - os for environment variables

# Optional: If you want to use a dedicated Linear SDK in the future:
# linear-sdk>=1.0.0  # Not required for current implementation

# Optional: Enhanced HTTP client for future improvements
# httpx>=0.24.0

# Optional: GraphQL client library for more complex queries
# gql>=3.4.0
# requests-toolbelt>=1.0.0
